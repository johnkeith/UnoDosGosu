unodos
======

John Keith & David Pointeau

Implementation in Ruby using Gosu!

__unodos__ is a unique game combining strategy, fast-thinking, and fun! In a rapidly evolving interface, the player's goal
is to obtain the words 'UNO' or 'DOS' as many times possible before the board fills up. Indeed, every 3 seconds a new tile 
is added to the board making it harder for the player to get 'UNO' or 'DOS'

Simply move the tiles one at a time by clicking on their respective arrows. 

Enable sounds for an incredible and immersive experience.

__THIS REPO INCLUDES AN EXECUTABLE PACKAGE THAT YOU CAN DOWLOAD__ Simply download this repo and unzip __unodos.app__. Launch
the package on local machine to play indifinitely!

This is the first version deployed. We will refactor some of the functionalities soon and make the game more fun and playable.
